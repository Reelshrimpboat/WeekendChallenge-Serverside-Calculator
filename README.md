# JQUERY SERVER-SIDE CALCULATOR

This project requires Node, use terminal command “npm install” to install dependencies and terminal command “npm start” will start the program.

## Description

This is a calculator made with JQuery and Javascript.  It functions like a basic calculator while also logging whatever calculations were made while the server is also running.

The visual design for the calculator is based off an old model of calculator found online that was similar to one I had as a kid.

This project was completed as a part of the Prime Digital Academy program, a six month full stack development immersion program.  This was a weekend challenge for the 8th weekend of the Prime program.
